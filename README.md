*Laser Gears* generates simple circular involute gears in 2d to be cut by a
laser printer.  It aims to be fast, simple, and stand alone. This means it has
no display: parameters go in, DXF file comes out, and you can use your favorite
viewer to see how it actually looks.

The originator of this project has zero mechanical engineering background, but
based upon very limited experience, these things were difficult:

* Existing tools are slow or embedded into CAD applications, making the process
  opaque and complicated.
* Relative sizing of the gears was not preserved. This is easily fixed by
  placing all the gears on one page.
* To account for laser tolerance is impractical.
